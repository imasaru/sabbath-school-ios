Sabbath School by Adventech. Studying Sabbath School has never been easier, brothers and sisters! Meet the new experience in our redesigned and updated app.

Just like our Seventh-day Adventist Church, this application is global and available in multiple languages.

Social sign-in using Google and Facebook allows data synchronization for your notes, highlights and comments.

Studying Sabbath School requires a Bible at hand or just tap away.

With highlighting and commenting, you can always remember your thoughts.

Prefer to study during the night? Try our Dark mode.
